#+TITLE: README

This firmware is responsible for receiving and processing ETROC2 datapackets, as
well as sending ETROC fast commands.

It takes in 8 bits / bx (320 Mbps) and outputs 40 bit frames. The input data can
be programmed to also be 16 bit, or 32 bit, and should work identically. It has
so far only been tested with 8 bit words due to limitations of the emulator.

The 8/16/32 bit words are grouped into 40 bit frames.

An automatic state machine bitslips the data until the frame is synced to the
ETROC dataformat specification.

The dataformat is saved in a yaml file, sourced from the `module_test_sw`
respository. A script in this respository will pull the latest dataformat yaml,
parse it to produce a VHDL package, which is then used by the data decoder as
well as the fast command generator.

Updating the dataformat can be done simply by running `make` in the `configs`
directory.

A simple syntax checking test bench also can be used by running `make` in the
pwd.
