[[file:doc/images/kcu_105.png]]

The KCU105 board has optics available on 2 SFPs and on a Firefly FMC.

The two SFP modules are included with the development kit and allow for connection to one LPGBT
each. This can be used for example to connect to two readout boards (DAQ only), or one readout board
(DAQ + Trigger).

Eight additional transceivers can be connected with a Firefly FMC, available at
https://www.samtec.com/kits/optics-fpga/14g-firefly-fmc. The of whether the FMC is required should
be made by each test stand.

*** Additional Shopping
Some additional components are needed to connect to a readout board.  Other additional components are optional.
**** VTRX Optical Adapter
The readout board features VTRX+ optics, which have a (female) MT12 Ferrule. To connect this to the
KCU105 board, you need to break this out into LC connectors.

The "proper" way to connect to the VTRX is with an actual MT ferrule with a spring clamp, but a male
MTP connector works fine.

***** Option A: Fanout Cable
You can use an "octopus cable" e.g.
 - https://www.fibertronics.com/1m-mtp-male-to-12-lc-upc-12-fiber-multimode-om3-50125-breakout-cable
 - 1m, MTP Male to 12 LC UPC, 12 Fiber Multimode OM3 50/125 Fanout Cable
 - $130

You also then need some LC fibers of whatever length you choose. e.g.
  - https://www.fibertronics.com/3m-lc-to-lc-duplex-om3-multimode-fiber-optic-patch-cable
  - 3m, LC to LC, Duplex, OM3 Multimode Patch Cable
  - Multimode, OM3, 50/125, 10Gb, 3.0mm, PVC (OFNR)

You also need some LC adapters, e.g.
 - https://www.fibertronics.com/lc-duplex-mm-10gb-om3-adapter-wo-flange-aqua
 - LC Duplex Aqua Adapter without Flange

***** Option B: Cassette
Another nice option that can be quite a bit more organized on the benchtop is to use a fiber
cassette. e.g.

You need one cassette:
- FHD-1MTP6LCDSMFA
- https://www.fs.com/products/57016.html

You need an MTP M-F connector
- MT-KL4EAP001MCS
- 1m, 12 Fiber MTP Cable, Multimode OM4, MPO - MPO
- Male to Female, Multimode, OM4, 50/125, ONFP, Method A
- https://www.fibertronics.com/1m-12-fiber-mtp-m-f-multimode-om4-method-a-4

You need several OM3 LC patch cables (of the length you prefer), e.g.
- PC-KK7S3AV01M
- 1m, LC to LC, Simplex, Multimode 50/125 Patch Cable
- Multimode, OM3, 50/125, 3.0mm, PVC (OFNR)
- https://www.fibertronics.com/1m-lc-to-lc-simplex-multimode-50125-patch-cable
**** Firefly Mezzanine Optical Components
The firefly adapter has a single MTP24 connector which mates with an MPO male (see drawing at:
http://suddendocs.samtec.com/prints/ref-193429-01-mkt.pdf)

This can be broken out to LCs with a cassette , e.g. https://www.fs.com/products/57024.html, which
mates with an MPO female. We

The two can be connected together with a 24 fiber MPO Male to Female cable, e.g.
https://www.fibertronics.com/1m-24-fiber-mtp-m-f-multimode-om4-pin-1-13-2

You then need a number of LC fiber patch cables to connect to the readout boards (through the breakouts described above).
**** MT-MPO Adapter
An MT to MPO adapter is recommended to ensure a good connection. An example is Molex p/n 1061141150:
